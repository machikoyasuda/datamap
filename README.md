Los Angeles Metro Rail data mapper
===

### Introduction:
Inspired by maps of SF and NYC, I wanted to create a map showing Los Angeles and its growing number of Metro Rail stations to explore datapoints around each station.

### Goals:
I want to learn how to use a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB with MongoMapper, with Ruby on Rails to pull data from various APIs, mash it together in a database and display it online. I want to practice using a JavaScript data visualizing library, like D3, HighCharts, Leaflet, etc.

### Tools:
1. **Where am I getting the data?** Census Bureau API, GTFS Metro Los Angeles feed (GTFS gem from https://github.com/nerdEd/gtfs), FCC Census Block mapper
2. **How amy I displaying the data?** D3 for mapping and charting
3. **Framework**: Ruby on Rails
4. **Database**: MongoDB with MongoMapper
5. **Testing**: Rspec, Jasmine
